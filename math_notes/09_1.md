# 0.9̅ = 1

0.9̅ is equal to 1 but there is no proof that will ever satisfy a person dead-set against this.

The misconception can usually be stated as:

```
0.9      ≠ 1
0.99     ≠ 1
0.999    ≠ 1
0.9999   ≠ 1
0.99999  ≠ 1
0.999999 ≠ 1
…
```

*Saying that if you add enough "9"s it suddenly equals 1 makes absolutely no sense to me, and I seriously doubt that anyone will be able to convince me that it does make sense* (which is correct: no finite representation of repeating 0.9s can equal 1 but…).

The [vinculum][1] allows multiple representations for decimal numbers. This shouldn't sound too strange, after all fractions can have multiple representations for the same underlying amount: 3⁄6 = 1⁄2.

But people seem to have the intuition that the decimal representation of a number is a number.

## Intuitive explanation

```
1/3 = 0.3̅
2/3 = 0.6̅
```

So what's 3/3?

## Algebraic prof

```
  𝑥 = 0.9̅
10𝑥 = 9.9̅
10𝑥 = 9 + 0.9̅
10𝑥 = 9 + 𝑥
 9𝑥 = 9
  𝑥 = 1
```

## Leonhard Euler's way (*Elements of Algebra*, 1770)

```
0.9̅ = 9⋅(1/10) + 9⋅(1/10)² + 9⋅(1/10)³ + …
```

This is a [geometric series][2] with start term 9 and common ratio 1/10. If the sequence is multiplied term by term by 1/10:

```
0.9̅⋅(1/10) = 9⋅(1/10)² + 9⋅(1/10)³ + …
```

and then subtracted from the original sequence:

```
0.9̅ - 0.9̅⋅(1/10) = 9⋅(1/10) + 9⋅(1/10)² + 9⋅(1/10)³ + …
                            - 9⋅(1/10)² - 9⋅(1/10)³ - …) = 9⋅(1/10)
```

only the first term remains. Also:


```
0.9̅ - 0.9̅⋅(1/10) = 0.9̅⋅(1 - 1/10)
```

so

```
0.9̅⋅(1 - 1/10) = 9⋅(1/10) ⇒ 0.9̅ = 9⋅(1/10) / (1 - 1/10) = 1
```
